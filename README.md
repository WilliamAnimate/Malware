# Malware
Is Malware. im not gonna be responsible for any damage though
## damage of running on real machine
- if you plan to do this as a joke to your friends, back up all their information and banking details or everything your friend cannot live without. but why would you do that?
- if you **ACCIDENTALLY** ran this on your real pc (dude) you can lose your pc (MBR overwrite/or if you ran a ransomware, data loss/or if there is a malware dangerous enough, wipe your bios, which is the worst case)
